    <span className="policy">Quality Guarantee- Regular Polish:</span> Regular
    polish applications may last in duration from 1 to 7-days depending on
    several factors specific to the client, including: client lifestyle, client
    health and following of maintenance instructions. Polished by Mia does NOT
    guarantee the longevity of ANY regular polish product once your appointment
    has been completed due to the varying factors explained above, the product
    formulation and manufacturer’s instructions on regular nail polish.
    <br />
    <span className="policy">Quality Guarantee-Gel Polish: </span> Gel
    Polish—often referred to as “Shellac”—is a light-cured polish product that
    may last a duration of 2-4 weeks depending on several factors specific to
    the client, including: client lifestyle, client health and following of
    maintenance instructions. However, there may also be additional
    complications in the application process, chemistry of the product and other
    factors that may cause product breakdown (peeling, lifting, fading,
    wrinkling, etc.) Due to this, Polished by Mia provides a 3-day guarantee
    period, in which if you experience any of these issues you may return to the
    salon to have a repair done FREE of charge. However, it is at Polished by
    Mia’s discretion! If we feel that your product breakdown was not caused by
    error in application and exceeds normal wear and tear you will be charged
    for the nail repair service.
    <br />
    <span className="policy">Quality Guarantee- 3D Embellishments:</span> All
    nail art fixtures with raised surfaces such as Jewels, glitter and 3-D
    embellishments are NOT guaranteed by Polished by Mia due to the
    unpredictable nature of the client’s daily activity that may cause loss of
    these items.
    <br />
    <span className="policy">Nail Fill Policy: </span> Maintenance should be
    performed on Nail Enhancement services every 2 to 3--weeks to ensure the
    integrity of your service and the health of your natural nails. Due to an
    increased product cost and increased appointment time required for
    maintenance on Nail Enhancements, those individuals who wish to receive or
    exceed a 4--week maintenance schedule will be charged for a Full Set.
